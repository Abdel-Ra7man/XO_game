# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## Overview
This is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game built using **Python and Tkinter**. The game allows players to choose between two modes:
- **1v1 Mode**: Two players take turns manually.
- **1vCPU Mode**: The player competes against an AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm.

## Features
- **Choose Game Mode**: Players can select between 1v1 or 1vCPU mode.
- **AI Opponent**: In 1vCPU mode, the computer uses the Minimax algorithm for optimal moves.
- **Graphical Interface**: Built with Tkinter for an interactive experience.
- **Win Detection**: The game automatically detects when a player wins or if there's a tie.
- **Automatic Turn Switching**: Handles turns between players or between the player and the AI.

## How to Play
1. Download the game executable from the **[latest release](## Tic-Tac-Toe Game

## How to Play
1. Download the game executable from the **[latest release](https://github.com/Abdel-Ra7man/XO_game/releases)**.
2. Run the **Tic-Tac-Toe.exe** file (no installation required).
3. When the game starts, a pop-up will ask you to **choose a game mode**:
   - **1v1**: Two players take turns playing on the same device.
   - **1vCPU**: You (X) play against the computer (O).
4. Click on any available square to make your move.
5. The game will check for a winner or a tie after each move.
6. A pop-up message will announce the winner or a tie, then the game will close.

## Download the Latest Release
You can download the latest version of the game from **[here](https://github.com/Abdel-Ra7man/XO_game/releases)**.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** (Programming language)
- **Tkinter** (GUI for Python)
- **Minimax Algorithm** (For AI logic)
- **PyInstaller** (For creating the executable file)

## Future Improvements
- Add a **Reset Button** to restart the game without reopening the script.
- Keep track of **player scores**.
- Improve **UI design** with better graphics.
